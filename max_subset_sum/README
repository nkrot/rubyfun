as a study problem
1) first implement the solution that outputs just the greatest sum
   a) here can use the followng to select the max value
        sum = [sum+nums[i], nums[i]].max

   b) also explain that the condition:
        sum > 0
      is a simplified form of the complete:
        sum + nums[i] > nums[i]
      where the nums[i] was deleted from the two sides of the equation
        sum > nums[i] - nums[i]
        sum > 0

   c) and use either of the following to select the new max_sum
        max_sum = sum  if sum > max_sum
        max_sum = [sum, max_sum].max

2) then extend the first solution to outputting the subset of the array that sums to the greatest value
   see script: max_sum_subset

  2.1) the following testcase fails
         > puts find_subset_with_max_sum([1,-5,1])  == [1]
       if the line
         > if sum >= max_sum
       is replaced with
         > if sum > max_sum
       THEREFORE: comment out this testcase, use the latter if and let the students solve the issue themselves.
