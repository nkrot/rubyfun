programming assignment on tagging from the MOOC  https://class.coursera.org/nlangp-001/class
trigram tagger using Viterbi algorithm

classes unigram_data and trigram_data use prebuilt resource with counts:

296 3-GRAM * I-GENE O
11967 3-GRAM O O STOP
13 2-GRAM I-GENE STOP
13047 2-GRAM * O
315457 2-GRAM O O
749 2-GRAM * I-GENE
13796 2-GRAM * *
32 WORDTAG O consists
15 WORDTAG O cartilage
4 WORDTAG I-GENE disease
8781 WORDTAG O _RARE_
8732 WORDTAG I-GENE _RARE_

where:
 * stands fake 1st word
 STOP stands for fake last word
 _RARE_ replaces all words with that occur < 5 times in the training corpus


TODO:
1. scripts for preparing such a stat resource
2. get rid of script level methods w_tags, wt_prob in bin/trigram_tagger
3. Viterbi should not define START and STOP but use them from either Unigram or Trigram or some common component
    TrigramData::STOP, TrigramData::START
4. Morphotype should be moved into Unigram. to keep the possibility to configure morphotype
    (a) either Morphotype is created outside of UnigramData and then passed to UnigramData
	(b) or Morphotype is instantiated in UnigramData and configured
		@unigrams.morphotype.use_rare = true
		@unigrams.morphotype.use_types_of_rare = true
5. how about merging unigram and trigram resources into a single stat resource with
   apropriate methods for get_trigram_prob, get_wt_prob

BUGS:
1. unknown words produce zero values
